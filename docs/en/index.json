Learn to be a commit ahead. If that seems hard^, then atleast make sure there are no conficting changes Ofcourse, we at CSITauthority do not ignore bad commits but, bad commits will take longer to appear on the main website. Lastly, don\u0026rsquo;t sweat the details. If you feel its good, push it. Moderators won\u0026rsquo;t let anything that shouldnt break, break.  Now, if the change your propose is good to go, please commit it one final time then push to your master Then you need to make a pull request from your forked repository. Once your pull request is submitted, moderators will make sure necessary changes are made. Your contributions are valuable to us. Expect to see YOUR content soon! You are now an official contributor.

	"content": " Minimal. Fast. Robust. The migration from Blogger CMS to Hugo demanded something radical. Following the design language, this is the answer. Two Strokes is completely vector generated with just two strokes and some mathematics!\nWhy does it matter? Well, for starters, its scalable from that to this and, thats not the end of it. It renders fast; no compromises for Hugo. Now, only TU keeps you waiting, not our DOM. The premise of this migration is to define a new standard in serving content through CSITauthority; our logo should keep up.\n Two Strokes \u0026copy; 2017 Siddhant Rimal\n "
