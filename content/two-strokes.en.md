### Minimal. Fast. Robust.

The migration from Blogger CMS to Hugo demanded something radical. Following the design language, this is the answer. _Two Strokes_ is completely vector generated with just two strokes and some mathematics!

#### Why does it matter? 
Well, for starters, its scalable from that to [this](../../images/csitauthorityLogo2017.svg) and, thats not the end of it. It renders _fast_; no compromises for Hugo. Now, only TU keeps you waiting, not our DOM. The premise of this migration is to define a new standard in serving content through CSITauthority; our logo should keep up.
